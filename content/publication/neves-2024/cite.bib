 abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) has seen rapid expansion, but this growth brings significant privacy challenges due to the large amounts of data generated by myriad IoT devices. To address these challenges, this study introduces Smart Anonymity, a method that determines the optimal data anonymization algorithm for a dataset by assessing its unique features. The solution leverages OWL ontologies grounded in description logic (DL), which facilitates inconsistency checks and the discovery of new facts for data validation. Additionally, machine learning (ML) is incorporated to improve the accuracy of these classifications. ML is also instrumental in recommending suitable anonymization algorithms, with the random forest algorithm being employed explicitly for this purpose. The findings from this research indicate that Smart Anonymity effectively improves user privacy.},
