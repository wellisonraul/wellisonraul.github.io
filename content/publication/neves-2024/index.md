abstract: The internet of things (IoT) has seen rapid expansion, but this growth brings
  significant privacy challenges due to the large amounts of data generated by myriad
  IoT devices. To address these challenges, this study introduces Smart Anonymity,
  a method that determines the optimal data anonymization algorithm for a dataset
  by assessing its unique features. The solution leverages OWL ontologies grounded
  in description logic (DL), which facilitates inconsistency checks and the discovery
  of new facts for data validation. Additionally, machine learning (ML) is incorporated
  to improve the accuracy of these classifications. ML is also instrumental in recommending
  suitable anonymization algorithms, with the random forest algorithm being employed
  explicitly for this purpose. The findings from this research indicate that Smart
  Anonymity effectively improves user privacy.
