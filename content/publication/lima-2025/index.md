abstract: IoT environments face significant security challenges due to their distributed,
  heterogeneous, and dynamic nature. Traditional security systems have been proven
  inadequate in addressing these complexities, prompting the exploration of advanced
  approaches like CTI and ML. However, their integration into IoT security is still
  underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive study on applying CTI and ML
  to detect and mitigate cyber threats in IoT networks. The study reviews recent approaches,
  classifying them into technical subdomains and highlighting the most effective ML
  techniques, such as neural networks, federated learning, and hybrid algorithms.
  The findings demonstrate that while ML has proven to be an interesting tool for
  identifying anomalies and sophisticated attacks, its integration with CTI platforms
  remains limited, hindering collaboration and the ability to anticipate threats.
  Furthermore, the analysis identified significant gaps, including the need for improved
  model explainability and the implementation of scalable, energy-efficient solutions.
  This work also discusses the challenges of creating integrated frameworks that combine
  the adaptability of ML with CTI, ultimately aiming to improve cybersecurity for
  IoT through more robust and proactive solutions.
