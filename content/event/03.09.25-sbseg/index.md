abstract: At Brazil's foremost cybersecurity event, SBSeg 2025, CISSA took a proactive role beyond mere observation. We engaged directly with researchers, prospective master's and doctoral candidates, and industry leaders to showcase our core mission and operational framework. The primary goal was to demonstrate CISSA's dual role as both a premier research institution and an incubator for talent and new ventures in cybersecurity. This presence facilitated crucial networking opportunities, leading to substantive discussions with academics from various institutions about future collaborations and with corporate representatives about potential technology partnerships. This strategic engagement proved highly successful, effectively introducing CISSA to a key audience, initiating dialogues to attract new talent and startups, and significantly strengthening our professional network.
