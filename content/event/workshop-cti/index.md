summary: I recently spoke at the first-ever CTI Workshop hosted by the CISSA team at CESAR. My presentation focused on how unsupervised AI can be used to create proactive cyber defenses here in Brazil. The event was a deep dive into our country's key security challenges, with expert sessions on protecting critical infrastructure, the impact of the LGPD, innovative national CTI projects, and strategies against advanced cyber threats (APTs). The workshop truly highlighted a collective commitment to strengthening Brazil's cybersecurity through collaboration and shared knowledge.
abstract: This presentation addresses the need for advanced defense mechanisms against sophisticated cyber threats in Brazil. It proposes the application of unsupervised Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a key strategy to enhance national protection capabilities, arguing that these models can identify novel threats without prior data, enabling more resilient security postures. This topic was situated within a broader agenda focused on Brazil's security landscape, including the protection of critical infrastructure, compliance with the LGPD, and strategies for combating Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
