summary: At the Red Hat Academy launch at CESAR School, I spoke on a panel about the future of cybersecurity. As a CISSA researcher, my key message was that the best way to develop skilled professionals is by combining academic research with hands-on training. The panel also debated major industry trends, the growing role of AI, and today's biggest security challenges.
abstract: This presentation addresses the critical demand for skilled professionals in the cybersecurity industry. It argues that the talent gap can be closed by integrating theoretical academic research with practical, applied training. This approach ensures that new professionals are equipped to handle complex, real-world security threats. The analysis is supplemented by a discussion of how emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence are shaping current industry trends and challenges.
