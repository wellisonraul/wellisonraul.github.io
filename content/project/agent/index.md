This project develops an intelligent agent powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically trained on ransomware data and integrated with existing security platforms. It aims to enhance the detection, contextual analysis, and response to ransomware attacks, making Security Operations Centers (SOCs) more agile and adaptive against the complexity and polymorphism of modern threats.
