This initiative proposes an intelligent cybersecurity data aggregator designed to combat the increasing complexity of threats. The solution will collect, integrate, clean, and semantically enrich data from diverse sources (logs, alerts, IoCs, reports, threat intelligence) to create high-quality datasets. These datasets will feed Large Language Models (LLMs) and other advanced AI to enable the identification of complex and contextual patterns, significantly enhancing threat detection and response in SOCs.
