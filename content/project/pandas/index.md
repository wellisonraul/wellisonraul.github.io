## Description

This research project examines two significant challenges faced by business and risk analysts when assessing compliance in business processes: the detection of complex and hidden behavioral deviations, and the identification of the causes of anomalous behaviors among employees co-opted by malware and ransomware franchises. Currently available methods often struggle to identify complex anomalies involving multiple dimensions of a business process.
