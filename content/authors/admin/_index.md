    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a researcher and professor who is passionate about building bridges between cutting-edge academic research and high-impact, practical solutions for the industry. My career is dedicated to exploring the frontiers of distributed systems, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and automation. My academic foundation was built at the [Center for Informatics (CIn)](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/) of the [Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE)](https://www.ufpe.br/), one of Brazil's most prestigious institutions, where I earned my Ph.D. (2024) and M.Sc. (2020) in Computer Science. During my PhD studies, I also had the honor of being a visiting research student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (UBC) in Canada. 

Today, my career is built on two fundamental pillars:

- Applied Research: As a Researcher at CISSA/CESAR, the EMBRAPII competence center for cybersecurity, I apply my expertise to develop innovative solutions in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to protect critical infrastructure in Brazil.
- Educating Future Talent: As a Professor at CESAR School and at Instituto Infnet, I have the privilege of teaching and mentoring the next generation of tech leaders on topics such as network architecture, DevOps, and cloud computing.
