      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a DevOps Engineer and Researcher with over 8 years of experience in distributed systems, cloud-native applications, and AI-driven automation. I hold a Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from at [Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE)](https://www.ufpe.br/), where my doctoral research focused on developing proactive self-adaptive systems for microservices performance. This included a visiting student period at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (UBC).

Currently, I am a Researcher at [CISSA](https://www.cesar.org.br/web/english/cissa), contributing to cybersecurity solutions through research in distributed systems and artificial intelligence, particularly Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). I am also a Professor at CESAR School and Instituto Infnet, teaching topics like network architecture and DevOps. I am passionate about bridging the gap between academic research and practical, impactful solutions.
