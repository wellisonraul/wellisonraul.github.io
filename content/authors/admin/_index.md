## About Me

I am a researcher and professor who is passionate about building bridges between cutting-edge academic research and high-impact, practical solutions for the industry. My career is dedicated to exploring the frontiers of distributed systems, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and automation. My academic foundation was built at the [Center for Informatics (CIn)](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/) of the [Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE)](https://www.ufpe.br/), one of Brazil's most prestigious institutions, where I earned my Ph.D. (2024) and M.Sc. (2020) in Computer Science. During my PhD studies, I also had the honor of being a visiting research student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (UBC) in Canada. 

Today, my career is built on two fundamental pillars:

- Applied Research: As a Researcher at CISSA/CESAR, the EMBRAPII competence center for cybersecurity, I apply my expertise to develop innovative solutions in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to protect critical infrastructure in Brazil.
- Educating Future Talent: As a Professor at CESAR School and at Instituto Infnet, I have the privilege of teaching and mentoring the next generation of tech leaders on topics such as network architecture, DevOps, and cloud computing.
