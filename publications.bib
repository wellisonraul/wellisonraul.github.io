    abstract={The internet of things (IoT) has seen rapid expansion, but this growth brings significant privacy challenges due to the large amounts of data generated by myriad IoT devices. To address these challenges, this study introduces Smart Anonymity, a method that determines the optimal data anonymization algorithm for a dataset by assessing its unique features. The solution leverages OWL ontologies grounded in description logic (DL), which facilitates inconsistency checks and the discovery of new facts for data validation. Additionally, machine learning (ML) is incorporated to improve the accuracy of these classifications. ML is also instrumental in recommending suitable anonymization algorithms, with the random forest algorithm being employed explicitly for this purpose. The findings from this research indicate that Smart Anonymity effectively improves user privacy.},

    abstract = {Time series forecasting has been applied to predict performance degradation in Microservice-Based Applications (MBAs). The prediction enables MBA adaptation to avoid performance degradation and maintain the customer experience. The approaches in the literature commonly perform the forecast using a single monolithic model. However, since no model is better than others for all possible scenarios, using only one increases the risk of inaccurate estimates. Thus, an alternative for improving the accuracy and robustness of the performance degradation of MBAs is to adopt an ensemble, i.e., a Multiple Predictor Systems (MPS). This paper proposes an MPS methodology that selects and combines the most suitable models to forecast test patterns from a pool of models. Experiments were carried out with 32 time series containing performance metrics commonly used for MBA adaptation. Different scenarios concerning the pool (homogeneous or heterogeneous) and the selection phase (static or dynamic) are considered. Likewise, six widely used models in the literature were employed for pool generation: ARIMA, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. The evaluation shows that the proposed solution maintains or improves the forecast accuracy on 26 out of 32 datasets (81.25%) compared to monolithic models. In particular, the homogeneous pool and the dynamic selection of predictors obtained very satisfactory results. Therefore, MPS provide more accurate decision-making for MBA interventions, avoiding incorrect adjustments that could degrade the customer experience.

    abstract = {Adaptive containerised systems have been developed using the Time Series Forecasting (TSF) technique. TSF analyses historical data patterns to estimate future trends, assuming they will occur again. Identifying future trends allows anticipating problems (e.g., high latency) and acting (e.g., replicating the service) to fix them before they occur. Depending on the number of features (i.e., metrics) used as input for prediction, TSF can be classified as univariate (single feature) or multivariate (two or more features). Despite the popularity of both TSF strategies, a unique strategy is typically implemented, and there is no comparison with the other. However, it is known that no strategy is the best choice for all possible scenarios. This paper presents a comparative study assessing univariate and multivariate proactive auto-scaling of containerised applications. A custom-made multivariate auto-scaling tool called Multivariate Forecasting Tool (MFT) was developed and compared with a production-grade univariate system called Predict Kube (PK). Both applications were evaluated using four popular open-source benchmark applications. The results show that the multivariate strategy decreased the response time of the evaluated applications in 75\% of the experiments (i.e., 9 out of 12) compared to the univariate, and it was more cost-effective in half of them (i.e., 6 out of 12). Furthermore, they also indicate that the multivariate strategy efficiency is more significant as the number of containers composing the application increases. This comparative study is expected to be a helpful guide for developers who want to choose the most effective proactive approach for their auto-scaling solutions.},

    abstract={IoT environments face significant security challenges due to their distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic nature. Traditional security systems have been proven inadequate in addressing these complexities, prompting the exploration of advanced approaches like CTI and ML. However, their integration into IoT security is still underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive study on applying CTI and ML to detect and mitigate cyber threats in IoT networks. The study reviews recent approaches, classifying them into technical subdomains and highlighting the most effective ML techniques, such as neural networks, federated learning, and hybrid algorithms. The findings demonstrate that while ML has proven to be an interesting tool for identifying anomalies and sophisticated attacks, its integration with CTI platforms remains limited, hindering collaboration and the ability to anticipate threats. Furthermore, the analysis identified significant gaps, including the need for improved model explainability and the implementation of scalable, energy-efficient solutions. This work also discusses the challenges of creating integrated frameworks that combine the adaptability of ML with CTI, ultimately aiming to improve cybersecurity for IoT through more robust and proactive solutions.},

abstract = {Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) have led to several challenges across domains, creating opportunities for new solutions. The large volume of data and high processing demands of IoT applications, typically handled by cloud providers, make this approach costly regarding storage, computation, and latency. This fact has led to the emergence of the fog computing paradigm that enables the integrated use of edge and cloud resources. In this new scenario, one of the main challenges is managing containerised IoT applications that may migrate from fog nodes (IoT Devices) to the cloud and vice versa. This management is needed to preserve system performance and user experience while considering cloud resource costs. The container migration becomes especially critical for battery-powered devices, whose energy autonomy is a significant concern. Existing solutions do not consider power consumption and the cost of fog-cloud settings in the migration process. This paper proposes IRAS-IoT (Intelligent Replacement as a Service for IoT), a solution for autonomously migrating containers between fog nodes and the cloud. Based on MAPE-K, IRAS-IoT adopts a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model to decide on migrating containers and optimising workload distribution according to devices’ power consumption. Regarding cost optimisation, in scenarios where fog nodes become overloaded, the solution may also allocate containers to a cloud provider, selecting the most cost-effective option. Experimental results show that IRAS-IoT reduces energy consumption by up to 18% and extends battery life by 34%, and lowers cloud operational costs compared to the baseline scenario.}
